# Bellabeat-FitBit-Projet

# Overview 
Bellabeat, a high-tech company specializing in health-focused smart products for women, aimed to analyze data from 30 FitBit users to gain insights into their usage patterns. The goal is to leverage these insights to drive growth and innovation within the company

# Business Understanding
The main stakeholders for this project include Urška Sršen, Bellabeat's co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Sandor Mur, Bellabeat's co-founder and a mathematician, the executive team at Bellabeat, and the marketing analytics team at Bellabeat. They are seeking insights into current customer usage of the devices to provide high-level marketing recommendations aimed at uncovering growth opportunities for one of Bellabeat's products.

# Data Understanding
I utilized FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain), made available through Mobius, containing minute-level data on physical activity, heart rate, daily activity, and steps for 30 consenting FitBit users. However, limitations include the small sample size and the age of the data, collected from April 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016, which may not fully represent the broader FitBit population

# Evaluation 


# Conclusion
- From our analysis, it's evident that customers may not be wearing their devices consistently, possibly due to the design of the watch. To address this, we recommend marketing the watch as versatile, suitable for any occasion, emphasizing its seamless integration into everyday life. This approach can encourage customers to wear the device continuously for both wellness tracking and style.
- Based on our insights, a significant portion of users exhibit sedentary behavior. To address this, we propose highlighting the watch's features in advertising, emphasizing its role in facilitating fitness and wellness goals. By showcasing its ability to track daily activity, sleep, and stress, users can better understand their habits and set achievable goals. For those embarking on a fitness journey, the watch serves as a valuable tool for tracking progress and adjusting behaviors to meet their goals. Our data suggests a positive correlation between activity level and calorie burn, reinforcing the watch's importance in promoting a healthier lifestyle.
- For customers with or considering personal trainers, the watch offers valuable insights into their daily activity and sleep patterns beyond training sessions. This data allows trainers to better understand their clients' overall habits, bridging gaps in their knowledge and enhancing their coaching strategies.

# Further Steps 
- The dataset provided had limitations due to its small sample size of only 30 FitBit users. To obtain more comprehensive insights, I recommend collecting data from a larger and more diverse user population.

- Conducting a survey to understand the duration of device usage per day would provide valuable insights into user behavior, particularly regarding activity levels.

- Additionally, administering a survey to ascertain the reasons behind users' decision to purchase the device would be beneficial. Understanding the primary motivations behind purchases can inform targeted marketing strategies tailored to specific demographics.
